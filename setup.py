It returns a tuple with the number of characters that match, mismatch, open gaps and extend gaps. The scores/penalties are given as arguments and the defaults correspond to the basic Levenshtein distance.\n\nIt can also produce a multiple sequence alignment.\n\nBased on Brent Pedersenâ€™s nwalign which was originally posted at https://bitbucket.org/brentp/biostuff/ but now has disappeared.\n\nFor more information, see chapter 7 of Robert Turnbull's thesis 'The Textual History of Codex Sinaiticus Arabicus and its Family'.\n\nDocumentation and code clean up to come.",
