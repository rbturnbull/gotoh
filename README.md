Performs a global sequence alignment (Needleman-Wunsch) with affine gap penalties (Gotoh). It returns a tuple with the number of characters that match, mismatch, open gaps and extend gaps. The scores/penalties are given as arguments and the defaults correspond to the basic Levenshtein distance.

It can also produce a multiple sequence alignment.

Based on Brent Pedersenâ€™s nwalign: https://bitbucket.org/brentp/biostuff/

Documentation and code clean up to come.
